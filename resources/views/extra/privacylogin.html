When you publish your information and/or share your data with other JOBSPEED users, you do so at your own risk. If you choose to share personal information with other users, including Sellers providing you a service via JOBSPEED, such personal information is shared with other users as separate controllers.

</span></p></li><li><p><span><i>For payments and fraud detection</i></span><span>.

Security</span></h3><p><span>
We implement technical and organizational measures to maintain the security of the Site, our services and personal information and in preventing unauthorized access, loss, misuse, alteration, destruction or damage to it through industry standard technologies and internal procedures.
