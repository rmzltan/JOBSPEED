        <h2>Sellers</h2>

        <h3>Basics</h3>

        <ul>
          <li>Sellers create FREELANCEs on JOBSPEED to allow Buyers to purchase their services.</li>
          <li>Sellers may also offer Custom Offers to Buyers in addition to their FREELANCEs.</li>
          <li>Each FREELANCE you sell and successfully complete, accredits your account with a revenue equal to 80% of the purchase amount.
          </li>
          <li>JOBSPEED accredits Sellers once an order is completed. See our <a href='#orders' class='js-scroll-to-section'>"Orders"</a>
            section below for a definition of a completed order.</li>
          <li>For more information about receiving payments, fees and taxes see the <a href="/content/payments-terms-and-conditions"
              target='_blank'>Payment Terms</a>.</li>
          <li>Sellers may not promote their FREELANCEs or any JOBSPEED content via the Google Ads platform.</li>
          <li>The Seller's rating is calculated based on the order reviews posted by Buyers or Business Account Team Members. High ratings
            allow Sellers to obtain advanced Seller levels (see Levels below). In certain cases, exceedingly low ratings may lead to the
            suspension of the Seller’s account.</li>
          <li>For security concerns, JOBSPEED may temporarily disable a Seller’s ability to withdraw revenue to prevent fraudulent or illicit
            activity. This may come as a result of security issues, improper behavior reported by other users, or associating multiple
            JOBSPEED accounts to a single withdrawal provider.</li>
          <li>Sellers are responsible for obtaining a general liability insurance policy with coverage amounts that are sufficient to cover
            all risks associated with the performance of their services.</li>
          <br>

        <h3>Seller Features</h3>

        <p>JOBSPEED Sellers have access to several exclusive features that help customize the way their services can be offered.</p>

        <h4>Custom Offer</h4>

        <ul>
          <li>Sellers can also send Custom Offers addressing specific requirements of a Buyer.</li>
          <li>Custom Offers are defined by the Seller with the exact description of the service, the price and the time expected to deliver
            the service.</li>

          <li>Services provided through Custom Offers may not violate JOBSPEED’s Terms of Service and/or our Community Standards.</li>
        </ul>


        <h4>Project Milestones</h4>

        <ul>
          <li>FREELANCE and Custom Offers above $100 may include up to six project milestones, the minimum amount for each milestone is $50
            and the project should include at least two milestones. Each milestone is paid and delivered separately in accordance with each
            FREELANCE or Custom Offer’s description and timelines.</li>
          <li>Once a milestone is delivered and marked as completed, Buyers may choose to either continue with the Order and pay for the next
            milestone, or to stop the Order. If Buyer does not pay for the next milestone within 10 days of acceptance of previous milestones,
            the Order under the next milestones will not start. A milestone will be automatically marked as complete if no acceptance or
            request for modification were submitted within 8 days after being marked as Delivered, however, in such case all further
            milestones will not start.</li>
        </ul>


        <h4>FREELANCE Subscription</h4>

        <ul>
          <li>Sellers may offer Buyers a fixed term subscription for a specific FREELANCE (the “FREELANCE Subscription”). During the FREELANCE
            Subscription term, Seller will deliver one Order of the same FREELANCE on a recurring basis, as agreed between the Seller and
            Buyer.</li>
          <li>Buyers may cancel future Orders under the FREELANCE Subscription before payment is made for such future Orders. In such case,
            the Orders under the FREELANCE Subscription will be cancelled, as applicable. Once payment is made, JOBSPEED’s Order Cancelation
            policy under the <a href="/content/payments-terms-and-conditions" target='_blank'>Payments Terms</a> will apply.</li>
          <li>Sellers may cancel the FREELANCE Subscription up to 10 days before the next consecutive Order. Otherwise, JOBSPEED’s Order
            Cancelation policy under the <a href="/content/payments-terms-and-conditions" target='_blank'>Payments Terms</a> will apply.</li>
        </ul>


        <h4>JOBSPEED Studios</h4>

        <ul>
          <li>A JOBSPEED Studio allows certain Sellers to collaborate with each other and offer Buyers a multi-service FREELANCE (a "Studio
            FREELANCE").</li>
          <li>Studio Lead: Certain selected Sellers may lead and operate JOBSPEED Studios as Studio Leads. Studio Leads are chosen manually by
            JOBSPEED editors through an ongoing review process based on seniority, volume of sales, high ratings, exceptional customer care,
            high order completion rate and more. The Studio Lead is responsible for inviting all Studio Members and managing all incoming
            Orders, from communicating with the Buyer, through handling any required revisions and until the final delivery. The Studio Lead
            can also remove Studio Members from Studio FREELANCEs at any time. With respect to open Orders, however, Studio Members can be
            removed by Customer Support only.</li>
          <li>Studio Members: A Studio Lead can invite other Sellers who were also chosen by JOBSPEED to be eligible for Studios collaboration
            (each, a "Studio Member") to join their Studio FREELANCE and be assigned to a specific service. Studio Members can ask to be
            removed from a Studio FREELANCE at any time.</li>
          <li>Studio FREELANCEs: A Studio FREELANCE provides a bundle of services (from two services and up to five) within one FREELANCE. A
            Studio FREELANCE’s minimum price is US$100. As Studio FREELANCE is comprised of several services, every service includes its own
            pricing, pricing factors, and a Studio Member / Lead that is accountable for such service, all of which is defined by the Studio
            Lead when creating the Studio FREELANCE. JOBSPEED Studios may also offer Custom Offers.</li>
          <li>Limitations: Each JOBSPEED Studio has one Studio Lead. Similarly, a Studio Lead may not operate more than one JOBSPEED Studio. A
            JOBSPEED Studio can offer up to five Studio FREELANCEs, each comprised of up to four Studio Members in addition to the Studio
            Lead. Studio Members may not be assigned to more than three Studio FREELANCEs.</li>
          <li>Studio FREELANCE Reviews: Studio FREELANCE Buyers are able to leave a public review on the Studio FREELANCE as if it were a

        <h3>Shipping Physical Deliverables</h3>

        <p>Some of the services on JOBSPEED are delivered physically (arts and crafts, collectable items, etc.). For these types of
          FREELANCEs, Sellers may decide to define a shipping pricing factor.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>FREELANCEs that include a shipping pricing factor must have physical deliverables sent to Buyers.</li>
          <li>Shipping costs added to a FREELANCE only pertains to the cost Sellers require to ship physical items to Buyers.</li>
          <li>Important: Buyers who purchase FREELANCEs that require physical delivery, will be asked to provide a shipping address.</li>
          <li>Sellers are responsible for all shipping arrangements once the Buyer provides the shipping address.</li>
          <li>JOBSPEED does not handle or guarantee shipping, tracking, quality, and condition of items or their delivery and shall not be
            responsible or liable for any damages or other problems resulting from shipping.</li>
          <li>A tracking number is a great way to avoid disputes related to shipping. We require entering the tracking number if available in
            the Order Page when delivering your work.</li>

        </ul>



        <h2><a name="orders"></a>Orders</h2>

        <h3>Basics</h3>

        <ul>
          <li>Once payment is confirmed, your order will be created and given a unique JOBSPEED order number (#FO).</li>
          <li>Sellers must deliver completed files and/or proof of work using the Deliver Work button (located on the Order page) according to
            the service that was purchased and advertised on their FREELANCE.</li>
          <li>The Deliver Work button may not be abused by Sellers to circumvent Order guidelines described in these Terms of Service. Using
            the “Deliver Work” button when an Order was not fulfilled may result in a cancellation of that Order after review, affect the
            Seller’s rating and result in a warning to Seller.</li>
          <li>An Order is marked as Complete after it is marked as Delivered and then accepted by a Buyer. An Order will be automatically
            marked as Complete if not accepted and no request for modification was submitted within 3 days after the Order was marked as
            Delivered.</li>
          <li>We encourage our Buyers and Sellers to try and settle conflicts amongst themselves. If for any reason this fails after using the
            Resolution Center or if you encounter non-permitted usage on the Site, users can contact JOBSPEED's Customer Support department
            for assistance <a href=http://support.JOBSPEED.com target='_blank'>here</a>. For more information about disputes, Order
            cancellations and refunds please refer to the <a href="/content/payments-terms-and-conditions" target='_blank'>Payment Terms</a>.
          </li>
          <li>Orders through the Logo Maker are completed once payment is made by the Buyer.</li>
          <li>A milestone (on an Order with milestones) is marked as Complete after it is delivered by the Seller and then accepted by the
            Buyer. A milestone will be automatically marked as complete if no acceptance or request for modification were submitted within 8
            days after being marked as Delivered, however, in such case the Order will be stopped and all further milestones will not start.
            Once a milestone is delivered and accepted, Buyers may choose to either continue with the Order and pay for the next milestone, or
            to stop the Order. If Buyer does not pay for the next milestone within 10 days of acceptance of previous milestones, the Order
            under the next milestones will not start. Please note that if you choose to stop the future milestones, the current ordered
            milestone will not be cancelled. </li>
          <li>Buyers may purchase a FREELANCE Subscription, if available on the Seller’s FREELANCE page. During the FREELANCE Subscription
            term, a new Order of the same FREELANCE will be automatically created on a recurring basis, as agreed between the Seller and
            Buyer. By purchasing a FREELANCE Subscription, you authorize us to automatically charge you for each Order under the FREELANCE
            Subscription from your JOBSPEED Balance or saved payment method, as applicable. If you do not have any JOBSPEED Balance or a saved
            payment method, you will be requested to approve the payment prior to the next Order. In case a payment is not processed or made
            by Buyer, for any other reason, the Orders under the FREELANCE Subscription will be cancelled. Buyer may also cancel future Orders
            under the FREELANCE Subscription before payment is made for such future Orders. Once payment is made, JOBSPEED’s Order Cancelation
            policy under the <a href="/content/payments-terms-and-conditions" target='_blank'>Payments Terms</a> will apply. Please note that
            Sellers can cancel future Orders under the FREELANCE Subscription 10 days prior to the next consecutive Order.</li>
          <li>Certain FREELANCEs that offer local services might require Buyers and Sellers to meet in person in order for the Seller to
            perform the service. In such cases, users should note that JOBSPEED does not guarantee the behavior, conduct, safety, suitability
            or ability of either Buyers or Sellers. Both Buyers and Sellers agree that the entire risk arising out of their meeting and/or
            their use or performance of local services remains solely with them, and JOBSPEED has no responsibility or liability related to
            any local services provided by the Sellers. In the event that the service is performed on the Buyers’ premises, Buyers are
            encouraged to maintain proper insurance policies to cover their liability as the premise owner. JOBSPEED’s Terms of Service and
            Community Standards remain applicable to Orders that are performed outside of the marketplace (including, among others, the below
            restrictions on Unlawful Use, Inappropriate Behavior & Language, and Targeted Abuse).</li>
        </ul>
        <p></p>


        <h3>Handling Orders</h3>

        <ul>
          <li>When a Buyer orders a FREELANCE, the Seller is notified by email as well as notifications on the site while logged into the
            account.</li>
          <li>Sellers are required to meet the delivery time they specified when creating their FREELANCEs. Failing to do so will allow the
            Buyer to cancel the Order when an Order is marked as late and may harm the Seller's status.</li>
          <li>Sellers must send completed files and/or proof of work using the Deliver Completed Work button (located on the Order page) to
            mark the Order as Delivered.</li>
          <li>Users are responsible for scanning all transferred files for viruses and malware. JOBSPEED will not be held responsible for any
            damages which might occur due to site usage, use of content or files transferred.</li>
          <li>Buyers may use the "Request Revisions" feature located on the Order Page while an Order is marked as Delivered if the delivered
            materials do not match the Seller's description on their FREELANCE page or they do not match the requirements sent to the Seller
            at the beginning of the order process.</li>
        </ul>


        <h3>Reviews</h3>

        <ul>
          <li>Feedback reviews provided by Buyers while completing an Order are an essential part of JOBSPEED's rating system. Reviews
            demonstrate the Buyer's overall experience with the Sellers and their service. Buyers are encouraged to communicate to the Seller
            any concerns experienced during their active order in regards to the service provided by the Seller.</li>
          <li>Leaving a Buyer's feedback is a basic prerogative of a Buyer. Feedback reviews will not be removed unless there are clear
            violations of our Terms of Service and/or our Community Standards.</li>
          <li>To prevent any misuse of our Feedback system, all feedback reviews must come from legitimate sales executed exclusively through
            the JOBSPEED platform from users within our Community. Purchases arranged, determined to artificially enhance Seller ratings, or
            to abuse the JOBSPEED platform with purchases from additional accounts, will result in a permanent suspension of all related
            accounts.</li>
          <li>Feedback comments given by Buyers are publicly displayed on a Seller’s FREELANCE page.</li>
          <li>Work Samples are the delivered images and videos sent to a Buyer in a delivery message. Work Samples are added to a Seller's
            Live Portfolio on their FREELANCE page if the Buyer chooses to publish the Work Sample while providing a public feedback review.
          </li>
          <li>Withholding the delivery of services, files, or information required to complete the FREELANCE’s service with the intent to gain
            favorable reviews or additional services is prohibited.</li>
          <li>Responding and posting a review: Once work is delivered, the Buyer has three days to respond. If no response is provided within
            the response period, the Order will be considered completed.</li>
          <li>Users are allowed to leave reviews on Orders up to 10 days after an Order is marked as complete. No new reviews may be added to
            an Order after 10 days.</li>
          <li>Sellers may not solicit the removal of feedback reviews from their Buyers through mutual cancellations.</li>
          <li>Once the Buyer submits his/her review, the Seller will receive a notification and will also have the opportunity to leave a
            review about working with the Buyer. Please Note: At this stage, Sellers cannot see the Buyer's review.</li>
          <li>Once both Seller and Buyer have completed their reviews, or the 10 days have passed, all posted reviews are made public.</li>
          <li>Responding to a review: Once both reviews from the Buyer and Seller have been published, the Seller can reply to the Buyer’s
            review from the Order page, seen on the Seller’s FREELANCE page, beneath the Buyer’s feedback.</li>
          <li>Feedback reviews are unavailable for orders made through the Logo Maker.</li>
        </ul>

          customize per their own specific needs, using special automated design tools. Through the Logo Maker, Buyers purchase full
          commercial use rights to the Logo Design embedded with their brand name.</p>
        <p>JOBSPEED Logo Maker Sellers are chosen manually by JOBSPEED editors through an ongoing review process based on quality of designs,
          seniority, volume of sales, high ratings, exceptional customer care, high order completion rate and more.</p>

          <li>By uploading a Logo Design to JOBSPEED Logo Maker you represent and warrant that it is your original work, you exclusively own
            all rights to such design, and it does not infringe any third party rights. You further warrant that such design was never sold
            before to anyone and that you will not offer it for sale outside of JOBSPEED Logo Maker.</li>
          <li>We may use automated systems that analyze your uploaded Logo Design to help detect and prevent infringement or other illegal
            content.</li>
          <li>We may limit the number of active Logo Designs you can offer.</li>
        </ul>


        <h3>Logo Design Commercial use license</h3>

        <p>When an order through the Logo Maker is completed, and subject to payment, the Seller grants the Buyer a worldwide, royalty-free,
          non-sublicensable, non-exclusive, irrevocable license to use the Logo Design embedded with the Buyer’s brand name for any purpose,
          except for any illegal, immoral or defamatory purpose. There is no warranty, express or implied, with the grant of this license,
          including with respect to fitness for a particular purpose. Neither the Seller nor JOBSPEED will be liable for any claims, or
          incidental, consequential or other damages arising out of this license, the Logo Design or the Buyers use of the Logo Design. For
          the avoidance of doubt, the Seller retains all ownership rights to the Logo Design, and no ownership or copyrights are granted to
          the Buyer.</p>

        <h3 class="fake-anchor-wrap"><a name="ownership"></a>Ownership</h3>

        <p>Ownership and limitations: When purchasing a FREELANCE on JOBSPEED, unless clearly stated otherwise on the Seller's FREELANCE
          page/description, when the work is delivered, and subject to payment, the Buyer is granted all intellectual property rights,
          including but not limited to, copyright in the work delivered from the Seller, and the Seller waives any and all moral rights
          therein. Accordingly, the Seller expressly assigns to the Buyer the copyright in the delivered work. All transfer and assignment of
          intellectual property to the Buyer shall be subject to full payment for the FREELANCE, and the delivery may not be used if payment
          is cancelled for any reason. For removal of doubt, in custom created work (such as art work, design work, report generation etc.),
          the delivered work and its copyright shall be the exclusive property of the Buyer and, upon delivery, the Seller agrees that it
          thereby, pursuant to these Terms of Service, assigns all right, title and interest in and to the delivered work to the Buyer. Some
          FREELANCEs (including for custom created work) charge additional payments (through FREELANCE Extras) for a Commercial Use License.
          This means that if you purchase the FREELANCE for personal use, you will own all rights you require for such use, and will not need
          the Commercial Use License. If you intend to use it for any charge or other consideration, or for any purpose that is directly or
          indirectly in connection with any business, or other undertaking intended for profit, you will need to buy the Commercial Use
          License through a FREELANCE Extra and will have broader rights that cover your business use.</p>
        <p>For Voice Over FREELANCEs, when the work is delivered, and subject to payment, the Buyer is purchasing basic rights, (which means
          the Buyer is paying a one time fee allowing them to use the work forever and for any purpose except for commercials, radio,
          television and internet commercial spots). If you intend to use the Voice Over to promote a product and/or service (with the
          exception of paid marketing channels), you will need to purchase the Commercial Rights (Buy-Out) through FREELANCE Extra. If you
          intend to use the Voice Over in radio, television and internet commercials, you will need to purchase the Full Broadcast Rights
          (Buy-Out) through FREELANCE Extra. For further information on the type of buy-outs, please read below.</p>
        <p>Furthermore, users (both Buyers and Sellers) agree that unless they explicitly indicate otherwise, the content users voluntarily
          create/upload to JOBSPEED, including FREELANCE texts, photos, videos, usernames, user photos, user videos and any other information,
          including the display of delivered work, may be used by JOBSPEED for no consideration for marketing and/or other purposes.</p>


        <h3 class="fake-anchor-wrap"><a name="voice-over"></a>Voice Over Commercial Buy-Out</h3>

        <p>When purchasing a Voice Over FREELANCE, the Seller grants you a perpetual, exclusive, non-transferable, worldwide license to use
          the purchased Voice Over (except for commercials, radio, television and internet commercial spots).<br>By purchasing a Commercial
          Rights (Buy-Out) with your order, in addition to the basic rights, the Seller grants you with a license to use the Voice Over for
          any corporate, promotional and non-broadcast purposes. Corporate, promotional and non-broadcast purposes means any business related
          use for the creation of, or to promote a for-product profit or service (with the exception of paid marketing channels), such as (by
          way of example): explainer videos posted to company websites, social networks or email campaigns, audiobooks, podcast intros, and
          strictly excludes any illegal, immoral or defamatory purpose.<br>By purchasing a Full Broadcast Rights (Buy-Out) with your order, in
          addition to the Commercial Rights, the Seller grants you with a license for full broadcasting, which includes internet, radio, and
          TV "paid channels" including (by way of example): television commercials, radio commercials, internet radio, and music/video
          streaming platforms, and strictly excludes any illegal, immoral or defamatory purpose.</p>
        <p>This Buy-Out is subject to JOBSPEED's Terms of Service. There is no warranty, express or implied, with the purchase of this
          delivery, including with respect to fitness for a particular purpose. Neither the Seller nor JOBSPEED will be liable for any claims,
          or incidental, consequential or other damages arising out of this license, the delivery or your use of the delivery.</p>


        <h3 class="fake-anchor-wrap"><a name="commercial-use-license"></a>FREELANCE Commercial Use License</h3>

        <p>By purchasing a “Commercial Use License” with your FREELANCE Order, the Seller grants you a perpetual, exclusive, non-transferable,
          worldwide license to use the purchased delivery for Permitted Commercial Purposes. For the avoidance of doubt, the Seller retains
          all ownership rights. “Permitted Commercial Purposes” means any business related use, such as (by way of example) advertising,
          promotion, creating web pages, integration into product, software or other business related tools etc., and strictly excludes any
